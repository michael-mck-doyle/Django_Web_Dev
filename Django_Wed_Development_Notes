Creating a Virtual Environment using PipEnv 

 

Commands: 

pipenv –three (creates a virtual environment using python 3 version installed on your machine) 

pipenv –rm (removes installed pipenv) 

pipenv check (checks whether your machine meets the requirements for using pipenv) 

Pipenv shell – starts the virtual environment 

Pipenv install django – installs django in the pipenv shell 

“django-admin startproject django_blog .” - this command creates a new django project in the virtual environment.  Note, the “.” at the end of the command is required in order to create the project inside the current folder 

python manage.py runserver – used to start the development server.  You can also specify the port you want the server to run on.  By default it is port 8000 I.e. http://localhost:8000/, however you can also specify a port by typing the port number e.g. python manage.py runserver 8080 

Control-C – use to quit server 

python manage.py migrate - apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions 

Python manage.py startapp blog – this command creates and starts an app called “blog” 

Python manage.py runserver		 

http://localhost:8000/ - Django web app location on local host, this is the default location when the server is started without specifying a port
